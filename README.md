# Pulsar-Voxel-Engine-1996
Voxel Engine written in Pascal/Assembly using Protected Real Mode in DOS

It worked kind of Minecraft in 2.5D. You could set 64x64 blocks consisting of ceiling and floor heightmaps. The height could be modified so you could create tunnels and stuff. One block with water had an animated heightmap.
