# Pulsar-Voxel-Engine-1996
Voxel Engine written in Pascal/Assembly using Protected Real Mode in DOS

It worked kind of Minecraft in 2.5D. You could set 64x64 blocks consisting of ceiling and floor heightmaps. The height could be modified so you could create tunnels and stuff. One block with water had an animated heightmap.


How to Run :
------------
The Program is only runable in DOS, without any Memory-Manager
( Himem,Emm,Qemm, ... )
Win95/98 user shoud press Shift+F5 at startup
( or press F8 , then choose safe Command Prompt )
WinNT/2000 - user should create a DOS-Boot-Disk.
( if the Prorgam is on a NTFS-Partition, there are DOS-Utilities
 available in the Net, which mount the Partition readonly )

Controls:
---------
-Standard DOOM-contols for moving
-For detailed Information, read the .DOC-File

How to Compile :
----------------
All Pascal Programs can simply be
compiled by Turbo/Borland Pascal 7.
If you modify the Assembler-Sources,you
also have to compile them by using TASM.
